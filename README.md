This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust programming: conflicting mutable and immutable references to the same value. The `bug.rs` file contains code that attempts to use both mutable and immutable references simultaneously. This will result in a compile-time error because Rust's ownership system prevents data races. The `bugSolution.rs` file shows how to correct this error by restructuring the code to ensure that only one mutable reference exists at a time.
